<h1>Introducing... the GoogleBar!</h1>

<em>Posted by Mike Perrow, Maps API Team</em>

Over the past few months, the AJAX Search API team has launched and improved their LocalSearch control for the Maps API. The LocalSearch control makes it easy for developers to add local business search functionality to their mashups.

Here on the Maps API team, we liked the LocalSearch control so much that we wanted to make it really easy for developers to add it to their maps. Today, we've released a new feature for the Maps API, which we've called the GoogleBar.

Developers who enable the GoogleBar will see the "Powered By Google" Logo on their map replaced with a shiny new control, which pops up a search box for the user so they can search the map for local listings. Take a look at the example below. You're looking at my old haunt in the old town of Edinburgh, Scotland. Try searching for a pub!

To enable the GoogleBar, simply call the enableGooglebar() method on the map object within your mashup:

<pre>
var map = new GMap2(document.getElementById("map"));
...
map.enableGoogleBar();
</pre>

As always, please post questions or comments in the Maps API forum.
