<h3>Error checking with GDownloadURL</h3>

<p>In this example, we download a static file (<code>"data.xml"</code>) that contains a 
list of lat/lng coordinates in XML using the <a 
href="http://www.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/reference.html#GDownloadUrl"><code>GDownloadUrl</code></a> 
method. It retrieves the resource from the given URL and calls the onload function 
with the text of the document as first argument, and the HTTP response status code as the 
second. The HTTP status code for success is 200. Since there is no HTTP status code 
returned for 
requests that time out, <code>GDownloadURL</code> will return a status of -1 and null 
data for timeouts.
You can read more about HTTP status codes <a 
href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
In this example, we process the text if the request was successful, and then alert 
errors if the request has timed out or errored. In your own applications, you may 
decide to do more or less error checking, depending on your needs.
</p>
<p>
When the download completes, we parse the XML with <a 
href="http://www.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/reference.html#GXml"><code>GXml</code></a> 
and create a marker at each of those 
points in the XML document.</p>

XML data file <a href="./data.xml">data.xml</a>.</p>
